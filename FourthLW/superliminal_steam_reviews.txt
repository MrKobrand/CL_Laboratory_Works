What begins as a fairly clever but not particularly outstanding spin on Portal (complete with a sassy AI with questionable motives and an enigmatic trainwreck of a corporation) with a unique gimmick gradually blooms into something strange and beautiful.
One of the best dreams i've ever had.
Superliminal is an amazing game that you'll have to think outside the box if you wanted to keep trying to find a way to escape your dream prison.
Great little puzzle platformer that gets you to literally think outside the box.
Shortly after figuring out how to manipulate the size of objects, the challenge disappears and the game effectively turns into a walking simulator.
The game is a masterpiece designed to melt your brain, then make you see your melted brain on the ground from the correct angle, reconstruct your brain, and then be made whole again.
Unique puzzle game that confuses your brain.
The aesthetic was incredible, the levels were beautiful, and this game will turn your brain inside out, and then do it to your heart, in the best way.
However, after playing it for 40 mins, I had to stop as the amount of times I had to spin around in narrow hallways and rearrange items made me feel very nauseous.
Don't be fooled with the "mind-bending impossible perspective puzzle" hype, there is no such thing.
