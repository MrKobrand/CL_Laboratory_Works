I (n) remember (v) a (n) long (v) time (n) ago (s), there (n) was (n) someone (n) talking (n) about (s) Anchorman (n), the (nf) 2004 (nf) Will (n) Ferrell (nf) film (n). This (nf) critic (n) said (v) something (nf) like (n), "Yeah (r), Anchorman (n) is (v) funny (n), but (r) I (n) do (n) not (r) know (n) if (nf) it (n) is (v) on (a) the (nf) level (n) of (nf) Ghostbusters (nf), Airplane (n), or (n) Planes (n), Trains (n) and (nf) Automobiles." (n)
My (nf) response (n) to (nf) that (nf) was (n), "Yeah (r), I (n) guess (n) it (n) is (v) not (r) as (n) funny (n) as (n) three (n) of (nf) the (nf) GREATEST (s) comedies (n) of (nf) the (nf) last (n) thirty (n) years (n). Good (n) point." (n)
Superliminal (nf) is (v) going (n) to (nf) draw (n) comparisons (n) to (nf) Portal (n) and (nf) The (nf) Stanley (n) Parable (n). Some (a) people (n) say (n) it (n) is (v) invalid (n) to (nf) directly (r) compare (n) games (n) in (n) criticism (n) because (nf) the (nf) reader (n) is (v) not (r) guaranteed (v) to (nf) have (n) played (v) those (nf). But (r) screw (n) that (nf), you (nf) have (n) at (n) least (n) played (v) Portal (n) and (nf) I (n) got (v) points (n) to (nf) make (n).
Portal (n), Superliminal (nf) and (nf) The (nf) Stanley (n) Parable (n) are (n) all (a) first-person (n) puzzle (n) games (n) where (n) an (nf) announcer (n) is (n) a (v) constant (n) companion (n). But (n) Superliminal (r) is (nf) not (v) as (r) sharply (n) designed (r) or (v) as (n) good (n) at (n) training (n) the (n) player (nf) as (n) Portal (n). (There (n) is (n) one (v) puzzle (n) that (n) I (nf) had (n) to (v) look (nf) up (n) the (v) solution (nf) for (n), and (nf) the (nf) game (nf) really (n) could (r) have (nf) stood (n) to (v) train (nf) the (n) player (nf) better (n) for (n) that (nf) one.) (nf) Nor (n) is (nf) Superliminal (v) as (nf) thoughtful (n) or (s) devastating (n) as (v) The (n) Stanley (nf) Parable (n), and (n) it (nf) is (n) not (v) half (r) as (n) funny (n) as (n) either (n) of (r) them (nf).
But (r) not (r) being (n) as (n) good (n) as (n) two (n) earnest (n) masterpieces (n) is (v) no (n) big (a) deal (n). I (n) enjoyed (v) my (nf) few (n) hours (n) with (nf) Superliminal (nf) just (a) fine (n) and (nf) was (n) satisfied (v) with (nf) it (n). It (n) also (r) does (n) not (r) really (r) get (n) as (n) dark (n) as (n) either (r) game (n), which (nf) is (v) sort (n) of (nf) a (n) relief (n). The (nf) Stanley (n) Parables (n) almost (r) relentless (s) futility (n) is (v) not (r) for (nf) everyone (nf). Superliminal (nf) has (n) a (n) lighter (n) tone (n) and (nf) no (n) chance (n) to (nf) 'lose' (v) or (n) 'die,' (n) I (n) do (n) not (r) think (n).
The (nf) asking (n) price (n) is (v) a (n) bit (n) of (nf) a (n) lurch (n), more (n) than (nf) either (r) Portal (n) OR (n) Stanley (n), so (n) I (n) would (nf) wait (n) for (nf) a (n) sale (n). Nevertheless (r), Superliminal (nf) is (v) bright (a), beautiful (a), mesmerizing.. (v). and (nf) sometimes (r) disorienting (v). Do (n) not (r) sleep (n) on (a) this (nf) one (n).
Or (n) if (nf) you (nf) do.. (n). do (n) not (r) forget (v) to (nf) wake (n) up (v).
